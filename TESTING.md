# Testing Strategy for the Script

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for testing the script to ensure it correctly processes the expected inputs and produces the correct outputs.

## Testing Methodology

### Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Test individual units of code for functionality.
- **Tools**: Utilize frameworks like `pytest` or `unittest` in Python.
- **Tests**:
  - Test data parsing functions to ensure they handle various formats and data types.
  - Test aggregation calculations for accuracy.
  - Test mock API call generation for correct format and data.

### Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that different parts of the script work together as expected.
- **Approach**:
  - Test the complete workflow from reading the CSV file to generating the final output.
  - Verify that the script interacts correctly with the mock API endpoints.

### Test Cases
- **Valid Inputs**: Run the script with well-structured and correctly formatted data.
- **Invalid Inputs**: Include tests with incorrect data formats, missing values, and invalid types to ensure the script handles these gracefully.
- **Edge Cases**: Test with unusually large data sets, empty files, or unusual characters.

## Reporting
- Document the results of all tests.
- Include information on any failures and steps taken to address them.
