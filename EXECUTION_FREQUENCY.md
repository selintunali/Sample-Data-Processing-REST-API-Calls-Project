# Script Execution Frequency: Daily vs. Weekly

## Overview
This document explores the impact of changing the script's execution frequency from daily to weekly.

## Data Volume and Timeliness
- Running the script weekly will process a larger volume of data per run.
- Less frequent updates mean the data will be less current.

## Aggregation and Calculations
- Modify aggregation logic to accommodate weekly data.
- Consider implications for metrics that were initially calculated on a daily basis.

## Resource Utilization
- Less frequent execution may reduce the load on systems.
- Schedule weekly runs during off-peak hours to optimize resource usage.

## Error Handling
- With less frequent runs, robust error handling becomes more crucial.
- Implement comprehensive logging to track any issues in weekly runs.
